# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)  

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository! ðŸš€  
This repository contains practical implementations of essential DSA topics, organized into folders based on the concepts. All programs are primarily written in **C++**, focusing on clarity and real-world applicability.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure  

### 1. **Struct**  
- **Description:**  
  Learn the basics of structuring data using `struct`. Topics include:  
  - Defining and using structures  
  - Nested structures  
  - Practical examples like managing student records or inventory systems  

### 2. **Stack and Queue**  
- **Description:**  
  Covers fundamental linear data structures:  
  - **Stack:** Implementation using arrays and linked lists, and applications like expression evaluation and backtracking  
  - **Queue:** Types of queues (simple, circular, deque) and their implementations  

### 3. **Linked List**  
- **Description:**  
  Dive into dynamic data structures, including:  
  - Singly linked lists: Insertion, deletion, and traversal  
  - Practical use cases like dynamic memory allocation  

### 4. **Double Linked List**  
- **Description:**  
  Expands on linked lists to include:  
  - Doubly linked lists: Bidirectional traversal and operations  
  - Examples showcasing efficient insertion and deletion  

### 5. **Sorting**  
- **Description:**  
  Explore various sorting algorithms with their complexities:  
  - Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort  
  - Advanced algorithms like merge sort and quick sort  
  - Real-world examples, such as sorting datasets  

### 6. **Searching**  
- **Description:**  
  Master searching techniques, including:  
  - Linear and binary search  
  - Applications in finding elements in arrays or linked lists  

### 7. **Tree Traversal**  
- **Description:**  
  Covers traversal methods in tree data structures:  
  - Pre-order, in-order, post-order  
  - Breadth-first and depth-first search (BFS and DFS)  
  - Practical applications in hierarchical data management
